# MachineLearningModels
This repository is dedicated to different machine learning models implemented from scratch, and other machine-learning related concepts. The goal was to visualise the effect of each model/concept, in a single, easy
to use script. I will be adding new models to it.

They usually come with some test data, intergrated in the script.

The required libraries are numpy, for faster and easier numerical computation, and matplotlib, for visualizing results.
They can be installed by typing "pip install numpy" and "pip install matplotlib", in the windows CMD.
